# python

This code is a folder synchronization program that allows synchronizing a source folder with a replica folder at a given time interval. The program uses the standard Python library for working with files and directories, os and shutil, and the argparse library for processing command line arguments.

The program starts by importing the necessary libraries:

import os
import shutil
import time
import argparse

Next, the program defines an ArgumentParser object of argparse and adds the arguments needed for the program:


parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument('source_folder', help='path to source folder')
parser.add_argument('replica_folder', help='path to replica folder')
parser.add_argument('interval', help='sync interval in seconds', type=int)
parser.add_argument('log_file', help='path to log file')
args = parser.parse_args()

The required arguments are: source_folder (the path to the source folder), replica_folder (the path to the replica folder), interval (the time interval in seconds to synchronize the folders), and log_file (the path to the log file).

Next, the program defines a function called sync that takes the necessary arguments and performs the synchronization of the folders. The function starts by checking if the source folder exists, and if it does not, it asks the user if he wants to create it.

If the source folder exists, the program starts an infinite loop that synchronizes the folders at given time intervals. Within the loop, the program obtains a list of files in the source folder and a list of files in the replica folder. For each file in the source folder, the program checks if the file exists in the replica folder. If it does not exist, the file is copied to the mirror folder and the operation is recorded in the log file. If the file already exists in the mirror folder, the program checks if the file in the source folder is more recent than the file in the mirror folder. If it is more recent, the file is copied to the replica folder and the operation is recorded in the log file.

Then, the program checks if there are files in the mirror folder that do not exist in the source folder. If there are files in the mirror folder that do not exist in the source folder, they are removed from the mirror folder and the operation is recorded in the log file.

After synchronizing the folders, the program waits for the specified time interval before synchronizing the folders again.

Finally, the program checks if it is running as the parent file and calls the sync function with the provided arguments:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sync(args.source_folder, args.replica_folder, args.interval, args.log_file).
This way, if the file is imported as a module in another program, the sync function will not be executed automatically.
